## 📘 What's Inside

### 🔹 1. Introduction to Signals
- Definition and classification: continuous-time, discrete-time, analog, digital
- Time-domain representations and transformations

### 🔹 2. Fundamental Signal Characterization & Visualization
- Unit impulse (δ), unit step (u), ramp, exponential, sinusoidal
- Discrete and continuous versions
- Properties: even/odd, periodicity, energy vs power

📈 **MATLAB scripts** visualize all signals and demonstrate core properties.

### 🔹 3. Fourier Series and Transform
- Fourier series: decomposition of periodic signals
- Fourier transform: frequency-domain analysis of aperiodic signals
- Real and imaginary parts, magnitude & phase plots
- Properties: linearity, time/frequency shifting, modulation, etc.

🔬 **MATLAB code** provided to demonstrate each concept clearly with examples and plots.

### 🔹 4. Advanced & Real-World Signals
- Sinc function (sampling theory connection)
- Exponential decay/growth signals
- Logarithmic signal behavior
- Signal combinations to mimic real-world phenomena

🌍 Visualize how these signals appear and behave in real applications like communications, audio, and biomedical signals.

### 🔹 5. 📑 Documentation & Learning Path
- Each script is self-explanatory and contains inline comments for learning
- Includes references, signal descriptions, expected outputs
- Designed to build intuition through coding, visualization, and mathematical grounding
